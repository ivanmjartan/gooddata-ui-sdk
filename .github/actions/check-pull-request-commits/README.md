## Usage

    uses: actions/checkout@v3
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0
  - name: Set commit range variables
    run: |
      echo "PR_HEAD=${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      echo "PR_BASE=${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: |
      cd ./.github/actions/check-pull-request-commits
      yarn install --frozen-lockfile
  - name: Check commit messages
    uses: ./.github/actions/check-pull-request-commits
    with:
      pr_head: ${{ env.PR_HEAD }}
      pr_base: ${{ env.PR_BASE }}
      lint_config: ./.github/actions/check-pull-request-commits/commitlint.config.js
```

## Development

The action is executed from `src/action.js`. There is no build or compilation. GitHub workflow must first
install action dependencies for action to work.

Unfortunately, widely used [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) compilation tool did not worked
with commit lint packages and produced build file that could not have been executed.
